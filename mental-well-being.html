      <h1 class="title">Mental Well-Being</h1>
      <p class="intro"> How might we help those struggling with high levels of stress
      maintain mental well-being? Through a series of design research methods, our team
      identified social relationships as a key element in maintaining
      mental well-being. We designed a mobile app to focus on social interactions
      that evoke positive attitudes. The positive attitudes generated from these
      interactions are meant to help individuals feel more empowered as they
      proceed with stressful activities in their daily lives.

        college dormitories showed a statistically significant positive correlation between interaction with others and feelings of purpose in life.
        Individuals who provide support to friends and see that their efforts were successful and appreciated experience increased positive emotions and meaning in life</p>

            <h3 class="subheader">Discussion</h3>
            <p class="maincontent">Our research started with user interviews to better understand young adults’
            relationships with mental well-being. The initial findings were that mental well-being is accomplished
            through a balance of work, social relationships and sleep. This was followed by a co-design method
            where we collaboratively designed a solution with a team of experts. Based on our co-design sessions,
            a low fidelity prototype was produced and user tested. Revelations from user tests led us to shift our
            focus on using social relationships to promote mental well-being. We proceeded with modified user
            enactments to further understand emotional reactions to sending and receiving positive messages.
            Existing literature also strongly supports the notion that social interactions are highly beneficial
            for mental well-being.
            <br><br>
            We see potential in our design -- our participants have expressed feeling strong positive
            emotions when receiving encouraging messages from their close friends in stressful moments.
            There are however limitations in our research. Some participants expressed discomfort while
            receiving notifications to send certain messages to others. This can impact participation
            within our app. Further research is necessary to better understand how these notifications
            can be better presented.
            <br><br>
            A few participants also stated that they tend to turn off their phones or notifications in
            real life situations where their full attention is required. This was not accounted for in
            our MUEs.
            <br><br>
            There were also some gaps in our co-design method. While we followed the co-design methods
            discussed by Sanders et al. to the best of our abilities, our participants defaulted to the
            creation of a mobile app because this is what they are used to. In retrospect, our team
            could have provided more encouragement to explore a wider array of options.
            This would have further validated a mobile app as being the best solution to our problem.
            <br><br>
            While our final design is grounded in research, additional research is necessary to measure
            the effectiveness of our final design. This can be accomplished through an additional
            round of user tests and interviews. </p>
            <h3 class="subheader">Conclusion</h3>
            <p class="maincontent">Social relationships have major contributions
            to mental well-being. Small interactions between close friends yield
            noticeable boosts in positive emotions. Positivity can help individuals
            when facing stress in their daily lives.</p>
