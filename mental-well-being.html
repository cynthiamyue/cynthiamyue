      <p class="intro"> Shared Moments is a mobile app that promotes mental
      well-being through social interactions. Through a series of design
      research methods, our team discovered that social interactions evoke
      strong positive attitudes. The positive attitudes generated from these interactions
      can be enough to help individuals feel more empowered
      and they proceed with stressful situations in their daily lives.

        <h3 class="subheader">Discussion</h3>
        <p class="maincontent">Our research started with user interviews to better understand young adults’
        relationships with mental well-being. The initial findings were that mental well-being is accomplished
        through a balance of work, social relationships and sleep. This was followed by a co-design method
        where we collaboratively designed a solution with a team of experts. Based on our co-design sessions,
        a low fidelity prototype was produced and user tested. Revelations from user tests led us to shift our
        focus on using social relationships to promote mental well-being. We proceeded with modified user
        enactments to further understand emotional reactions to sending and receiving positive messages.
        Existing literature also strongly supports the notion that social interactions are highly beneficial
        for mental well-being.
        <br><br>
        We see potential in our design -- our participants have expressed feeling strong positive
        emotions when receiving encouraging messages from their close friends in stressful moments.
        There are however limitations in our research. Some participants expressed discomfort while
        receiving notifications to send certain messages to others. This can impact participation
        within our app. Further research is necessary to better understand how these notifications
        can be better presented.
        <br><br>
        While our final design is grounded in research, additional research is necessary to measure
        the effectiveness of our final design. This can be accomplished through an additional
        round of user tests and interviews. </p>
        
        
        <!--<h3 class="subheader">Conclusion</h3>
        <p class="maincontent">Social relationships have major contributions
        to mental well-being. Small interactions between close friends yield
        noticeable boosts in positive emotions. Positivity can help individuals
        when facing stress in their daily lives.</p>-->
