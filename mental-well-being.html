      <h1 class="title">Mental Well-Being</h1>
      <p class="intro"> How might we help those struggling with high levels of stress
      maintain mental well-being? Through a series of design research methods, our team
      identified social relationships as a key element in maintaining
      mental well-being. We designed a mobile app to focus on social interactions
      that evoke positive attitudes. The positive attitudes generated from these
      interactions are meant to help individuals feel more empowered as they
      proceed with stressful activities in their daily lives.

        This was employed to further understand our users’ emotional reactions
        to receiving positive messages from close friends, and users' willingness
        to send similar messages. We recruited participants expressing high stress levels due to quickly approaching finals
        for MUE lab sessions. Mobile devices were provided and acted as low fidelity props.
        Our team orchestrated a series of messages to these devices and observed participants’ reactions to each message.

        <p class="maincontent"> There is further support for harnessing social relationships to foster mental well-being. “Relatedness”,
        which is important to well-being, can be generated through shared activities that reinforce relationships by creating shared experiences. A study of
        college dormitories showed a statistically significant positive correlation between interaction with others and feelings of purpose in life.
        Individuals who provide support to friends and see that their efforts were successful and appreciated experience increased positive emotions and meaning in life</p>
