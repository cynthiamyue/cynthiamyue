      <p class="intro">
        This 4-hr design challenge was part of my  hiring process at IBM. 
        <br><br>
        The challenge: 
        Redesign parts of a website for the world’s largest museum: The Louvre. 
        <br><br>
        Your co-worker, a user researcher, has analytics that show <b>many users are looking for information
             on prominent pieces of art, but are leaving before they find what they want. </b>
             Propose changes to address this feedback.
      </p>

  <div style="background-color: #edf5ff;padding:1px 25% 40px 25%; margin:25px 0px 25px 0px;">
      <h3 class="subheader">The Problem</h3>
      <p class="maincontent">Users can’t find relevant information on prominent pieces of art at the Louvre because it is likely their first time conducting research on the matter, and thus they are unsure of what to look for specifically.
      </p>
      <br><br>           
      <h3 class="subheader">The Solution</h3>
        <ul  class="counts">
            <li class="counts">Provide a clear path to relevant information by adding iconic images to the home page that can easily be recognizable as “prominent”.</li>
            <li class="counts">Don’t make the user think. Clearly outline what “prominent pieces of art” are available at the Louvre, and tell users why they should care.</li>
            <li class="counts">Provide expert information, but disclose it progressively.</li>

        <p class="maincontent">The first thing I did was employ the 5 Whys method — where you ask the question ‘why?’ recursively 5 times —  to get better understanding of the specific problem to solve for.
        <br><br>
            Start: users can't find information relevant to prominent pieces of art at the Louvre.
        </p>
        <ul class="counts">
            <li class="counts">Why can't the user find relevant information? <br> <i>user doesn't know where to look</i></li>

            <li class="counts">Why doesn't the user know what to look for specifically? <br> <i>user doesn't know much about the Louvre and what it has to offer</i></li>
            <li class="counts">Why doesn't the user know much about the Louvre? <br> <i>user has never had the motivation to learn more</i></li>
            <li class="counts">Why hasn't the user ever had the motivation to learn more? <br> <i>user has not had the opportunity to visit the Louvre, or Paris for that matter (until now)</i></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="maincontentheader">The specific problem</p>
        <p class="maincontent">
            Users can't find relevant information on prominent pieces of art because they don't know what they're looking for.
        </p>
        <p class="maincontentheader">The Louvre's website</p>
        <p class="maincontent">
            While the Louvre’s website provided rich quality content on a large selection of art, I felt that improvements can be made to address the specific problem I’ve outlined for this challenge. Someone visiting the website looking for prominent art pieces can easily get lost in the details presented here.

        The solution starts with idea #5 in providing an iconic / clearly recognizable piece of art  — the
         Mona Lisa — front and center of the home page with the headline “Prominent Art Pieces,” giving 
         the user a clear entry point for sought after information. 
         <br><br>
         Next, adopting idea #3 to not make the 
         user thing. The proceeding pages present the different categories of “prominent art,” along with 
         image galleries for each one. This adds some progressive disclosure, giving the user some 
         digestible information. 
         <br><br>
         Lastly, when specific image is clicked, rich, detailed information is 
         displayed for that particular art piece — idea #1. 
      </p>
      
      <h3 class="subheader">Final Thoughts</h3>
      <a class="toc" href="#process">back to table of contents</a>
      <p class="maincontent">
         This was a 4-hr project that was never meant to be a complete redesign. My intention here was to showcase my design process. My solution — a med-fi wireframe — is meant to fit seamlessly into the existing Louvre design by leveraging already existing content and design patterns, which are common constraints. 
 
         If I had more time, I would’ve done a few things differently. 
         
         First, starting with a validation  of my user stories, which can be achieved through interviews. 
         
         Secondly, I would’ve liked to use terminology that resonates with the user. I stuck with “prominent art” because that’s what was in the prompt. But, does this verbiage mean anything to our users? A simple A/B test can help answer this question. 
         
         Lastly, I would’ve loved to pursue idea #7 a little further. It was plotted as having a high impact, but low feasibility. It would’ve been fun to spend a couple more hours flushing out the idea of 3D experiences that intertwine digital with physical space to see if there are attributes there that can be applied to a more feasible solution.
