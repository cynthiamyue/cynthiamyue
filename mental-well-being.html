      <p class="intro"> Through a series of design research methods, our team
      identified social relationships and positivity are key elements in maintaining
      mental-well being. We designed a mobile app to focus on social interactions
      that evoke positive attitudes. The positive attitudes generated from these
      interactions are meant to help individuals feel more empowered as they
      proceed with stressful activities in their daily lives.

        which is important to well-being, can be generated through shared activities that reinforce relationships by creating shared experiences. A study of
        college dormitories showed a statistically significant positive correlation between interaction with others and feelings of purpose in life.
        Individuals who provide support to friends and see that their efforts were successful and appreciated experience increased positive emotions and meaning in life</p>
