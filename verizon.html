				<h1>Verizon - Video Streaming on GO90</h1>
				<h3>The Team</h3>
				<p>Cynthia Yue - UX Designer<br>
				Yicheng Zhu - Project Manager, UX Designer<br>
				Zhengnan Zhao - Visual Designer<br>
				Yingjie Ding - Data Analyst</p>
				<p>We worked with Verizon’s Open Innovation team to conduct user research on video consumption habits for their video streaming platform, GO90.</p>
				<h2>Double Diamond Method:</h2>
				<p>We applied the Double Diamond Method to serve as a foundation to guide us through our project.</p>

				<h2>Verizon's GO90 Platform</h2>
				<p>Worked with Verizon's Open Innovation team to increase the discoverability of their video content.</p>
				<h2>Goal</h2>
				<p>Increase user activity from millennials on the GO90 platform.</p>

				<h2>Rip the Goal</h2>
				<p>The process starts with us asking a single question that is fundamental to our goal: “How do people consume video content?” We then deconstructed our question into three main categories: People, Consumption and Video Content. As a team, we continued formulating questions that are relevant to each category. </p>

				<p>This enabled us to achieve a holistic understanding of the circumstances surrounding an individual’s video watching experience. From here, we identified key questions we needed to focus on in the research phase.</p>
				<h2>Research</h2>
				<p>Carried out in two parts: Field Research and Desk Research.
				<br><br>Field Research consisted of 2 carefully conducted online surveys that collected over 200 responses and one-on-one interviews with 12 participants. </p>

				<p>Mapping out the questions for our first survey
				<br><br>Desk Research involved analyzing existing research and literature on the video streaming industry. We examined competitors’ products and recorded our experiences with them.</p>

				<h2>Key Findings</h2>
				<p>From data collected in our surveys, we were able to quantify and highlight key findings:  </p>

				<p>Using both survey and interview data, we created two personas to represent our key demographics.</p>

				<h2>New Goal</h2>
				<p>Improve content discoverability and increase GO90 user engagement</p>
				<h2>HMW (How Might We?) & Design Ideation</h2>
				<p>How might we improve the design? Based off of our findings, our team came up with a handful of possible solutions to meet our goal.
				<br><br>How might we improve internal search? 
				<br>Finding: 50% - 61% of users search for specific titles within a video platform.
				<br>Solution: place search bar in a location that is more consistent with our competitors. Our personas consume video content on multiple platforms. Having search function in a familiar location will reduce friction when users attempt to search.
