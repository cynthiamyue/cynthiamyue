				<h2>Composting Crowd</h2>
				<p>Composting crowd is a mobile app designed to reduce waste.</p>
				<h2>Application of the Double Diamond Method</h2>

				<h2>General Problem</h2>
				<p>Not enough college students compost. Despite overconsumption and overproduction of garbage being a large detriment to the environment, composting is not a common practice amongst full-time college students living on or near campus. </p>
				<h2>User Research</h2>
				<p>To gain a better understanding of the daily habits related to students’ composting behaviors, we recruited five undergraduate students to participate in our interviews. The interviews took place in the home of each participant, during the daytime after the participant has made a meal. This is the best time to observe how participants handle organic food waste, and for us to ask follow up questions based on their behavior. </p>

				<h2>Insight</h2>
				<p>Six major themes that emerged from synthesized field notes include: previous knowledge, factors for and against composting, feelings about composting, external motivations for composting, amount of food waste produced and preferred method of communication.

				<p class="center"> Synthesized notes</p>
				<p>None of our participants had designated compost bins present at their residence. Ease of use was cited as the primary reason for a participant’s decision to not regularly compost. Generally, participants would be more willing to compost regularly if the task did not involve a lot of extra effort. Past experiences and knowledge on the composting process were also identified as contributing factors to a participant’s willingness to start composting more frequently. Participants were more willing to compost if a close friend or relative actively composts. Participants did not feel confident in their understanding of what composting is, and did not know how to compost at home even when there was a willingness to.  Lastly, text messaging and social media were the most common modes of communication amongst these individuals. 
				</p>
				<h2>Specific Problem </h2>
				<p>It is too difficult for full time undergraduate students to compost regularly.</p>
				<h2>Design Ideation</h2>
				<p>We designed for users who generally understood the environmental benefits of composting, but did not feel like they knew enough about composting to engage frequently. In the ideation phase of our project, we generated 100 different design solutions that focused on ease of use.
